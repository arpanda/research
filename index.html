        <p>I am a computational biologist with six years of postdoctoral research experience. My academic background includes a bachelor's degree in information technology and a Ph.D. in Computational Biology. My research focuses on understanding the role of genomic alterations in disease, aging, and normal phenotypic variation, as well as developing computational methodologies to study these processes. I investigate how different types of genomic changes—ranging from single nucleotide variants to larger structural rearrangements—affect gene function, regulation, and cellular behavior. I am particularly interested in the integration of multi-omics datasets to better interpret the biological consequences of these alterations. A key aspect of my work is the integration of multi-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, to build a more holistic view of these alterations in their biological context. </p>

            <h3> Variant Function using multi-omics integration</h3>
            <p> We used comprehensive multi-omics integration approach to uncover the functional role of the noncoding variant rs55705857, which is strongly associated with increased risk of IDH1-mutant low-grade glioma. By combining genomic fine-mapping, epigenomic profiling (including ATAC-seq, histone modifications, and Hi-C), transcriptomic analyses, and in vivo mouse modeling, the researchers demonstrated that this variant resides within a brain-specific enhancer that, when altered, disrupts OCT2/4 transcription factor binding. This disruption enhances enhancer-promoter interaction with the MYC oncogene, leading to its upregulation. Functional assays in genetically engineered mice confirmed that the variant significantly accelerates gliomagenesis. This work exemplifies how multi-omics integration can move beyond association to mechanistically link noncoding genetic variation to cancer development.</p>
