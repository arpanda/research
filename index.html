            <p>I am a computational biologist with six years of postdoctoral research experience. My academic background includes a bachelor's degree in information technology and a Ph.D. in Computational Biology. My research focuses on understanding the role of genomic alterations in disease, aging, and normal phenotypic variation, as well as developing computational methodologies to study these processes. I investigate how different types of genomic changes—ranging from single nucleotide variants to larger structural rearrangements—affect gene function, regulation, and cellular behavior. I am particularly interested in the integration of multi-omics datasets to better interpret the biological consequences of these alterations. A key aspect of my work is the integration of multi-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, and epigenomics, to build a more holistic view of these alterations in their biological context. </p>
